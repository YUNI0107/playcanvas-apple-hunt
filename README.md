# PlayCanvas-React & Cat hunt Apple 🍎

![Banner](/public/readme.png)

I was super excited when I saw the playcanvas team released playcanvas-react, so I had to try it out since I already have some playcanvas experience.

### About Game

It's a cat feeding game! You can spawn delicious fruits on an island and guide a cat to eat them. 🐾

### Challenges

- When a react component's state changes, entity position resets to (0,0,0).
- Instead of `setPosition` in the script's update function, handle position updates inside the React component currently.

I'm still try to figuring out how to integrate React's state management and event handling with playcanvas-react.
